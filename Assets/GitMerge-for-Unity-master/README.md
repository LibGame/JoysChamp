## Current project state

After five long years, Unity suddenly fixed issue #17 for us.
The project is now back to a state full of potential, but it has years of Unity updates to catch up to.

### Currently working:
* Merging scene files (although this needs to be refined and thoroughly tested).
* Merging prefabs (but the newer prefab features, nesting and variants, are not explicitly supported yet. There needs to be testing, at least).

### Currently in need of work:
Please check the v2.0 milestone for a list of important issues.
